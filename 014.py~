Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?

The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:

n  n/2 (n is even)
n  3n + 1 (n is odd)

def CollatzChain(n):
    if n == 1: return 1
    if n % 2: return 1 + CollatzChain(3*n+1)
    return 1 + CollatzChain(n/2)
