#What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

import prime

def main(factors = {}):
    for num in xrange(11,21):
        current_factors = prime.factorization(num)
        for prime in current_factors:
            if prime not in factors: factors[prime] = current_factors[prime]
            elif factors[prime] < current_factors[prime]: factors[prime] = current_factors[prime]
    return reduce(lambda a,b: a*b, zip(factors.keys(), factors.values()), 1)

20 = 2^2 * 5
19 = 19
18 = 2 * 3^2
17 = 17
16 = 2^4
15 = 3 * 5
14 = 2 * 7
13 = 13
11 = 11

All others are included in the previous numbers.

ANSWER: 2^4 * 3^2 * 5 * 7 * 11 * 13 * 17 * 19 = 232 792 560
