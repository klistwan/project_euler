These are my solutions to the Project Euler problems (http://projecteuler.net).

As of Oct 11/2011, I'm still in the process of adding my older solutions.

TO DO:
	Problem 111) Rewrite code; remove having to check obvious composite numbers (anything ending in 0,2,4,5,6,8); make cleaner/readable.
	Problem ???) For bouncy number questions, check out: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4983258/python-how-to-check-list-monotonicity
