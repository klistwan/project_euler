"""We shall say that M(n, d) represents the maximum number of repeated digits for an n-digit prime where d is the repeated digit, N(n, d) represents the number of such primes, and S(n, d) represents the sum of these primes. For d = 0 to 9, the sum of all S(4, d) is 273700.

Find the sum of all S(10, d)."""
